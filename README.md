# Self-Driving-Car-using-Raspberry-Pi
In this project, we will develop a self-driving car that utilizes advanced neural network technology along with sensors to navigate autonomously. The car will be controlled by a neural network that processes real-time images captured by a camera. Our implementation will leverage the Raspberry Pi as the core processing unit.
